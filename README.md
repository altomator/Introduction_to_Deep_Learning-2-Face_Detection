## Hands-on session 
This Jupyter notebook gives access to Gallica images thanks to the IIIF Image API and performs face detection based on a ResNet SSD network. 
The [OpenCV/dnn](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/02/26/face-detection-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) module is used to do so.

To view the Jupyter notebook: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/altomator/Introduction_to_Deep_Learning-2-Face_Detection/blob/main/binder/faces-detection-with-dnn.ipynb).
